# react-url-search-params
A zero-dependency, type-safe library for managing URL query parameters in React with schema-based validation. It includes a built-in schema generator, eliminating the need for external validation libraries like Zod or Yup. Query parameter changes automatically create a new entry in the browser history, ensuring seamless navigation.
